I am a passionate Mechanical Engineering graduate from Delhi Technological University (DTU, 2020), eagerly looking to pursue an MS in AI/Robotics to further my expertise in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence.

#### Journey

In university, i served as a Autonomous Systems Lead for Team [InfernoDTU](https://www.youtube.com/@teaminferno). The Achievements include 6th
Rank in IRC(Indian Rover Challenge) among 32 international teams.

3+ years developing AI for smart cities and autonomous vehicle systems at startups like [Euler Motors(valuation at $300M)](https://www.eulermotors.com).

Next step for me is Masters.

#### Research Interests

My work lies at the fascinating intersection of deep learning and robotics, with a focus on:

- Computer Vision
- Perception Systems
- Mobile Robotics
- Vision Language Transformers
- End-to-end control (perception-to-actuation) of autonomous systems

#### Why MS is My Next Step

My industry experience in AI and autonomous systems has shown me the cutting edge - and the expertise needed to push it further. An MS will:

1. Deepen my theoretical foundations
2. Expose me to advanced research
3. Hone skills crucial for innovation in robotics and AI

It's the bridge between my practical experience and future contributions to the field.
